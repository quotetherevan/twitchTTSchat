## 4. üîë Twitch Developer Setup (OAuth Login)

Since Twitch discontinued the old `twitchapps.com/tmi` method, you‚Äôll generate your own OAuth tokens via the **Twitch Developer Console**.

1. Go to [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).
2. Click **‚ÄúRegister Your Application‚Äù**.

   * **Name:** `TTS Chat App`
   * **OAuth Redirect URL:** `http://localhost:17563`
   * **Category:** `Chat Bot`
3. Copy down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Keep your Client Secret safe and never share it.

---

## 5. ‚öôÔ∏è First-Time App Setup

When you first run the app (`python twitch_tts.py`):

* You‚Äôll be asked to enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
* The app will open a **Twitch login page** in your browser.
* Once you approve, the app automatically retrieves your **OAuth Token**.
* This token is saved securely in `config.json` for future sessions.

---

## 6. üó£Ô∏è Voices & Voice Manager

* In the GUI, you can choose a **Default Voice**.
* You can also allow Twitch chatters to switch their voice by typing a special command (example: `!voice brian`).
* The **Voice Manager UI** shows all active chatters with buttons to change their voice on the fly.
* A **Preview Voice** button lets you test each voice with a sample phrase.

  <!-- TODO: Allow entering a custom preview message for better testing -->  

---

## 7. ‚õî Blacklist & Autoplay

* You can **Blacklist Users** to mute their messages.
* Import/Export blacklist as `.txt` files.
* Toggle **Autoplay** to have all chat messages read aloud automatically.

---

## 8. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

Run the app with:

```bash
python twitch_tts.py
```

---

‚úÖ Done! You‚Äôre now ready to use Twitch TTS Chat with real Twitch login and multiple voices.
